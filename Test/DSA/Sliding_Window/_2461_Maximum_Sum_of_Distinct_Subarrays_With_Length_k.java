//		Q)  Here we need to find the max sum
//			of ele with in subarray who's window size is "k"
		
//		condition -> All the elements of the subarray are distinct.
		
//		Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
//		Output: 15
//		Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
//		- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
//		- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
//		- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
//		- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
//		- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
//		We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions
