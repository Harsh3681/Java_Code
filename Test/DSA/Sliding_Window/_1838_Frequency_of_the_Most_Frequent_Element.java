//		The frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.
//
//		You are given an integer array nums and an integer "K". In one operation,
//		you can choose an index of nums and increment the element at that index by 1.
//
//		Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations.
		
//		Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
//		Output: 3
//		Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
//		4 has a frequency of 3.
